Dear Reader,


Please find the slides and samples in three sub-directories:

Delphi-5-to-2006
----------------

This describes a large migration done at Nationale Nederlanden.
They are the insurance branch of ING, and did a massive migrtion.
The migration was from Delphi 5 to Delphi 2006, Windows N4 to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, new SQL Server, new Imaging workflow and a lot more.
With a total of 100+ projects we managed to not have this project outsourced to India (they estimated 14000+ hours of work), but in The Netherlands.
The final number of man hours was close to 5000 in less than 6 months time, which made management really happy.


Delphi-2007-2009
----------------

This is based on an application migration in the optical business.
They use a lot of forms and data modules.
Our first basic migration took only 2 days.
The estimated finalization (fixing all the loose ends) is estimated to cost about 1 week more.


CrossTalk-beta
--------------

Shows you how to convert a simple CrossTalk program from Delphi 7 to Delphi 2009.



Please let me know how your conversions go.

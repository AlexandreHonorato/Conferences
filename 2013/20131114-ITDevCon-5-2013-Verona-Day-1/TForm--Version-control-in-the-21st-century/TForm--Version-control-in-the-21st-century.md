#Version control in the 21st century

Like Delphi has made great advances in this century, so has version control. The old skool VCS based systems were usually depending on a central server. Nowadays you have DVCS (or Distributed Version Control Systems) that only require you to be online when exchanging updates with other repositories. The extra D in the abbreviation might seem more difficult, but usually it is easier. During this session, Jeroen shows the differences between the old and new world, explaining how to take the most benefit in single developer and team based projects. Most examples during the session are with SVN/Subversions for old skool, and HG/Mercurial for modern DVCS. You will also learn some tips and tricks to bind your DVCS to public services like Bitbucket, Google Code or SourceForge, and learn which files to include/exclude from version control and how to ease that process.

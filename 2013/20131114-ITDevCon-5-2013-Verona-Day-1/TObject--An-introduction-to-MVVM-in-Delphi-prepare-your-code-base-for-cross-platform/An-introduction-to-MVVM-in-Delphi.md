#An introduction to MVVM in Delphi: prepare your code base for cross platform

Given the increase of platforms you can cover with Delphi it pays to make your existing code open to the user interfaces of new platforms, and for better testing. Other development environments have gone through the same transition, and MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) is a great pattern to use. Jeroen explains how to use the MVVM pattern in Delphi, distributing the user interface, business logic and data layers over the View, ViewModel and Model parts. The aim is to have as little code in the View as possible, so you can write user interfaces for more platforms with less code and at the same time make it easier to automatically test Model and ViewModel. As a bonus, you will see how to structure your projects and directories to make the cross platform game as smooth as possible.

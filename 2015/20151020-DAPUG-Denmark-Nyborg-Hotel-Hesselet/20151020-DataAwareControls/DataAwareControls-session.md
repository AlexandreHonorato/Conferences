    - We go back to old-school but very important VCL: most applications use VCL and databases.

    - Based on some reusable techniques you will see how you can both make your database centric code easier as well as your user-interface cleaner while still using the familiar data ware control, datasource, dataset adagium.
    - Two important parts are a data-aware control controller, and a dataset helper.
    - As a side effect you will see how the data aware controls and data source are internally bound using data-links and learn about modularisation of your code.

As I could not find the Delphi 5 VCL Object Hierarchy poster on-line any more, and there are more recent versions online, here are two that I could find:

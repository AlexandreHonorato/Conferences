How to partition your applications using Model View ViewModel

You will learn how to partition your applications by dividing them in a Model, View and ViewModel. Then hook them up into a loosely coupled way that makes the UI far less heavy pushing business logic where it belongs in automatically testable portions of your code base. This session demonstrates both the DSharp way (mimiced after Caliburn) and Knockoff (mimiced after Knockout JS) of using MVVM so you get a feel from what existing frameworks can do, or how to start rolling your own.

During presentation I've used the [full powerpoint slides](01-Intro-MVVM-DSharp-Caliburn/An-introduction-to-MVVM-in-Delphi.pptx).

For reading however, it is much easier to go through the Markdown files:

- [MVVM in Delphi using the Caliburn Micro for Delphi framework](01-Intro-MVVM-DSharp-Caliburn/MVVM-in-Delphi-using-the-Caliburn-Micro-for-Delphi-framework.md)
- [Steps in `MindScape_AppView_StepByStep.groupproj`](02-DSharp-MindScape-AppView-StepByStep/DSharp_MindScape_AppView_StepByStep.groupproj)

The [Knockoff materials](KnockOff-Session) are not yet in article format, but does show the steps how to write the same simple VCL application.

Most of the session focuses on the why and how both frameworks work and ahighlight of the steps of building the example application using each framework. We've not shown FMX, but you can do that using both frameworks. The Caliburn for Delphi Markdown actually shows you how to do that.

You can follow the steps at your own leasure after the conference.

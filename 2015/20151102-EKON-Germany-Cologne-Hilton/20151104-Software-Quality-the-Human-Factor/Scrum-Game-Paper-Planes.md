# Scrum game -- paper planes

There will be 2-3 sprints

#### Sprint goal: paper planes, measuring distance

- Fold paper planes
- Fly them
- Measure maximum distance
- Measure how many did/didn't Fly

#### Refinement/Retro processes (retro discusses refinement and accomplishmehts)

- Team name
- Design plane
- Process of plane building
- Process of measurement/statistics

- Rule: first sprint decide on team name too.

#### Scrum (planning cermony + build phase)

- Rule: no 2 folds by the same person in a row.
  So: if you made a fold, pass the paper over to someone else.

#### Demo ceremony

- put results in matrix on flipover/whiteboard
- 1st sprint also put team name on flipover/whiteboard

#### Overal results

- not a competition between teams
- competition with yourself: improve sprints over time
- how did your team approach the sprints and improve over time?

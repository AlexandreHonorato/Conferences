# Highlights of Software Quality: the human factor

[KÃ¶ln, Germany, 20151102](http://web.archive.org/web/20151101154208/http://entwickler-konferenz.de/2015/de/sessions/improving-software-quality)

- Slides: <http://github.com/jpluimers/Conferences>
- Blog: <http://wiert.me>

    These blocks give the highlights of enhancing the quality of your software.
    It is based on a Delphi flavoured explanation of topics a couple of books that I will bring:

        - Code Complete
        - Refactoring: improving the design of existing code
        - Design Patterns: elements of re-usable object oriented software

    Some topics covered are how to essentials for writing good software, classic mistakes of writing bad software,
    the human factor in software development, reducing failure, emotions versus technique and processes.

    You will do some tasks helping you shedding some light on how people actually work and cooperate.

All of the slides of the full course are in the [PowerPoint slides](20151104-Improving the quality of your Delphi apps.ppt).

As the first 2 days of the Conferences covered a lot of technical aspects of the full workshop, these two blocks focus on the human aspects and are highly interactive.

At the end of the last block, there is a [game](Scrum-Game-Paper-Planes.md) in which the audience is divided into development teams (of around 8-12 persons per team) that solve and later optimize some development process.

That game (or maybe better phrased "practice") is a fun way to experience how development processes work giving you inspiration for application in your own flots of work.
